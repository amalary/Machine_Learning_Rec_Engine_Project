# Recommendation Engine Project

This repository contains a collection of machine learning notebooks that
explore and implement **recommendation systems** across multiple domains
--- books, real estate, and advertisements. The goal is to build,
evaluate, and compare approaches that personalize suggestions to
end-users.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📂 Project Structure

-   **`Recommending Books.ipynb`**\
    Implements collaborative filtering and/or content-based techniques
    to suggest books to readers based on user preferences, ratings, or
    book metadata.

-   **`Real Estate Properties.ipynb`**\
    Applies recommendation logic to property listings, helping match
    users to relevant real estate options using features such as price,
    location, and property attributes.

-   **`Matching Advertisements to Users.ipynb`**\
    Focuses on personalized ad targeting by aligning user profiles with
    advertisement metadata to improve engagement and click-through
    predictions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🚀 Features

-   End-to-end pipelines for recommendation across three industries.
-   Data preprocessing: cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory
    data analysis (EDA).
-   Model training with approaches such as:
    -   Content-based filtering\
    -   Collaborative filtering (user--item matrices, similarity
        scores)\
    -   Machine learning--based ranking/matching models
-   Evaluation metrics for recommender systems (e.g., precision, recall,
    F1, RMSE).
-   Visualization of recommendations and dataset insights.

## 🛠️ Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/rec-engine-project.git
    cd rec-engine-project
    ```

2.  Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

    ``` bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # (Linux/Mac)
    venv\Scripts\activate      # (Windows)

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📊 Usage

Each notebook is self-contained. To run:

``` bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then open one of the `.ipynb` files and run the cells step by step.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📈 Example Applications

-   **Books**: Recommending novels based on past reads and ratings.\
-   **Real Estate**: Suggesting properties that match buyer
    preferences.\
-   **Advertising**: Serving tailored ads that maximize engagement.

These use cases demonstrate the versatility of recommender systems
across industries.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔮 Future Work

-   Integrate deep learning approaches (e.g., neural collaborative
    filtering, transformers).\
-   Deploy models as APIs for real-time recommendation.\
-   Unify the three domains into a single multi-domain recommender
    framework.\
-   Expand evaluation using offline/online A/B testing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📌 Requirements

A `requirements.txt` should include key dependencies, e.g.:

    numpy
    pandas
    scikit-learn
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    jupyter

(Add any domain-specific libraries you used.)
